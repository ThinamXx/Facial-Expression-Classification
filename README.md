## I have used my own **Dataset** to train the **Model**.
## Important URL for Data Preparation: 
```javascript
urls=Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.rg_i')).map(el=> el.hasAttribute('data-src')?el.getAttribute('data-src'):el.getAttribute('data-iurl'));
window.open('data:text/csv;charset=utf-8,' + escape(urls.join('\n')));
```
